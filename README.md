# Hi, I'm Abdellah Essordo 👋

I'm a full stack software engineer working at the intersection of product, performance, and infrastructure. I love building web and mobile applications that solve real-world problems — fast, clean, and scalable.

### 💼 Currently at [Fitle](https://fitle.com)

Our solution boosts **conversion rates by 8%**, reduces **returns by 15%**, and delivers **11× ROI** to our partners.
